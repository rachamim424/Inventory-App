A professional inventory management application built with **Flutter** and **Provider**. This project demonstrates clean architecture, state management, and responsive UI design.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Inventory Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Delete) functionality.
* **Smart UI:** Uses `Dismissible` widgets for intuitive "Swipe-to-Delete" actions.
* **Keyboard-Aware:** Scrollable input dialogs to prevent overflow on smaller screens.
* **Optimized Logic:** Efficient data handling using Dart's `fold` and `UnmodifiableListView`.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **State Management:** `Provider` for predictable data flow.
* **Data Integrity:** Private lists with public unmodifiable views to prevent accidental mutation.
* **UI Components:** Material 3 design with custom Dialogs and SnackBars.
